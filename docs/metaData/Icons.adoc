=== QIcon
Icons are defined in a QQQ Instance in a `*QIcon*` object.

#TODO#

*QIcon Properties:*

* `name` - *String* - Name of an icon from the https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/[Material UI Icon set]
** Note that icon names from the link above need to be converted from _CamelCase_ to _underscore_case_...
* `path` - *String* - Path to a file served under the application's web root, to be used as the icon.

_Either `name` or `path` must be specified. If both are given, then name is used._
