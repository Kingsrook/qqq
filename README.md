# qqq-sample-project
This repo serves as a sample or demo of how a client might deploy qqq.  

It defines the meta-data for a sample project (e.g., mysql credentials and table(s)).

It has a Javalin (http) server, and a Pico-CLI - both very very thin, just basically loading up the pertinent qqq codes.
