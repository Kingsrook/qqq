[#Backends]
== Backends
include::../variables.adoc[]

A key component of QQQ is its ability to connect to various backend data stores, while providing the same interfaces to those backends - both User Interfaces, and Programming Interfaces.

For example, out-of-the-box, QQQ can connect to:

* <<RDBMSBackendMetaData,RDBMS>> (Relational Database Management Systems, such as MySQL)
* File Systems (<<S3BackendMetaData,Amazon S3>> or <<FilesystemBackendMetaData,local disk>>)
* <<APIBackendMetaData,JSON Web APIs>> (_using a custom mapping class per-API backend_).
* In-Memory data stores

All {link-tables} in a QQQ instance must belong to a backend. As such, any instance using tables (which would be almost all instances) must define 1 or more backends.

=== QBackendMetaData
Backends are defined in a QQQ Instance in a `*QBackendMetaData*` object.
These objects will have some common attributes, but many different attributes based on the type of backend being used.

*QBackendMetaData Properties:*

* `name` - *String, Required* - Unique name for the backend within the QQQ Instance.
* `backendType` - *String, Required* - Identifier for the backend type being defined.
** This attribute is typically set in the constructor of a `QBackendMetaData` subclass, and as such does not need to be set when defining a backend meta data object.
* `enabledCapabilities` and `disabledCapability` - *Sets*, containing *Capability* enum values.
Basic rules that apply to all tables in the backend, describing what actions (such as Delete, or Count) are supported in the backend.
** By default, QQQ assumes that a backend supports _most_ capabilities, with one exception being `QUERY_STATS`.
** #TODO# fully explain rules here
* `usesVariants` - *Boolean, default false* - Control whether or not the backend supports the concept of "Variants".
** Supporting variants means that tables within the backend can exist in alternative "variants" of the backend.
For example, this might mean a sharded or multi-tenant database backend (perhaps a different server or database name per-client).
Or this might mean using more than one set of credentials for connecting to an API backend - each of those credential sets would be a "variant".
** A backend that uses variants requires additional properties to be set.  #TODO complete variant documentation#

In a QQQ application, one will typically not create an instance of `QBackendMetaData` directly, but instead will create an instance of one of its subclasses, specific to the type of backend being used.
The currently available list of such classes are:

==== RDBMSBackendMetaData
The meta data required for working with tables in an RDBMS (relational database) backend are defined in an instance of the `*RDBMSBackendMetaData*` class.

*RDBMSBackendMetaData Properties:*

* `vendor` - *String, Required* - Database vendor.  Currently supported values are: `aurora`, `mysql`, `h2`.
* `jdbcUrl` - *String, Optional* - Full JDBC URL for connecting to the database.
** If this property is provided, then following properties (which are the components of a JDBC URL) are ignored.
In other words, you can either provide the `jdbcUrl`, or the individual components that make it up.
* `hostName` - *String, Conditionally Required* - Hostname or ip address of the RDBMS server.
* `port` - *Integer, Conditionally Required* - Port used to connect to the RDBMS server.
* `databaseName` - *String, Conditionally Required* - Name of the database being connected to, within the RDBMS server.
* `username` - *String, Conditionally Required* - Username for authenticating in the database server.
* `password` - *String, Conditionally Required* - Password for authenticating in the database server.

==== S3BackendMetaData
The meta data required for working with tables in an Amazon S3 backend are defined in an instance of the `*S3BackendMetaData*` class.

*S3BackendMetaData Properties:*

* `bucketName` - *String, Required* - Bucket name to connect to inside AWS S3.
* `accessKey` - *String, Required* - Access key for connecting to S3 inside AWS S3.
* `secretKey` - *String, Required* - Secret key for connecting to S3 inside AWS S3.
* `region` - *String, Required* - AWS region containing the Bucket in S3.
* `basePath` - *String, Required* - Base path to the files within the S3 bucket.

==== FilesystemBackendMetaData
The meta data required for working with tables in a (local) filesystem backend are defined in an instance of the `*FilesystemBackendMetaData*` class.

*FilesystemBackendMetaData Properties:*

* `basePath` - *String, Required* - Base path to the backend's files.

==== APIBackendMetaData
The meta data required for working with tables in a web API are defined in an instance of the `*APIBackendMetaData*` class.

QQQ provides a minimal, reasonable default implementation for working with web APIs, making assumptions such as using `POST` to insert records, and `GET` with a primary key in the URL to get a single record.
However, in our experience, almost all APIs are implemented differently enough, that a layer of custom code is required.
For example, query/search endpoints are almost always unique in how they take their search parameters, and how they wrap their output.

To deal with this, a QQQ API Backend can define a custom class in the `actionUtil` property of the backend meta-data, as a subclass of `BaseAPIActionUtil`, which ideally can override methods at the level where unique functionality is needed.
For example, an application need not define the full method for executing a Query against an API backend (which would need to make the HTTP request (actually multiple, to deal with pagination)).
Instead, one can just override the `buildQueryStringForGet` method, where the unique details of making the request are defined, and maybe the `jsonObjectToRecord` method, where records are mapped from the API's response to a QRecord.

#todo - full reference and examples for `BaseAPIActionUtil`#

*APIBackendMetaData Properties:*

* `baseUrl` - *String, Required* - Base URL for connecting to the API.
* `contentType` - *String, Required* - value of `Content-type` header included in all requests to the API.
* `actionUtil` - *QCodeReference, Required* - Reference to a class that extends `BaseAPIActionUtil`, where custom code for working with this API backend is defined.
* `customValues` - *Map of String â†’ Serializable* - Application-defined additional name=value pairs that can
* `authorizationType` - *Enum, Required* - Specifies how authentication is provided for the API.
The value here, dictates which other authentication-related properties are required.
Possible values are:
** `API_KEY_HEADER` - Uses the `apiKey` property in an HTTP header named `API-Key`.
_In the future, when needed, QQQ will add a property, tentatively named `apiKeyHeaderName`, to allow customization of this header name._
** `API_TOKEN` - Uses the `apiKey` property in an `Authroization` header, as: `"Token " + apiKey`
** `BASIC_AUTH_API_KEY` - Uses the `apiKey` property, Base64-encoded, in an `Authroization` header, as `"Basic " + base64(apiKey)`
** `BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME_PASSWORD` - Combines the `username` and `password` properties, Base64-encoded, in an `Authroization` header, as `"Basic " + base64(username + ":" + password)`
** `OAUTH2` - Implements an OAuth2 client credentials token grant flow, using the properties `clientId` and `clientSecret`.
By default, the id & secret are sent as query-string parameters to the API's `oauth/token` endpoint.
Alternatively, if the meta-data has a `customValue` of `setCredentialsInHeader=true`, then the id & secret are posted in an `Authorization` header (base-64 encoded, and concatenated with `":"`).
** `API_KEY_QUERY_PARAM` - Uses the `apiKey` property as a query-string parameter, with its name taken from the `apiKeyQueryParamName` property.
** `CUSTOM` - Has a no-op implementation at the QQQ layer.
Assumes that an override of `protected void handleCustomAuthorization(HttpRequestBase request)` be implemented in the backend's `actionUtil` class.
This would be
* `apiKey` - *String, Conditional* - See `authorizationType` above for details.
* `clientId` - *String, Conditional* - See `authorizationType` above for details.
* `clientSecret` - *String, Conditional* - See `authorizationType` above for details.
* `username` - *String, Conditional* - See `authorizationType` above for details.
* `password` - *String, Conditional* - See `authorizationType` above for details.
* `apiKeyQueryParamName` - *String, Conditional* - See `authorizationType` above for details.
